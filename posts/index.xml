It was made with Love2D and with some assets from itch.io, it&amp;rsquo;s a small clone of the mini game &amp;ldquo;Journey of the Prairie King&amp;rdquo; which can be played in Stardew Valley.

This game was my first attempt at Unity and it was a bit of a challenge at that time. It features a score mechanic, powerups and it&amp;rsquo;s difficulty increases every 10 seconds or so, adding more enemies to the level.

It was made for the &amp;ldquo;Open Jam 2018&amp;rdquo; and the theme for that jam was &amp;ldquo;Spam to win&amp;rdquo; so it&amp;rsquo;s a mix of platformer with a snowball spam mechanic.
