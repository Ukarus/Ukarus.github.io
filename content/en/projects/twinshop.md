## Summary

Twinshop is a project I worked for the Universidad de Chile which consisted of a web application that shows real-time information about manufacturing machines and works in conjunction with sensors and algorithms to identify uptime and downtime periods. This application was part of an investigation and development project for the IMA (Advanced Manufacturing Engineering).

## Demo

## Tech Stack

- Flutter v3
- Firestore Database
- Cloud Functions

## Functionalities

- Realtime status (on and off) of the manufacturing machines.
- Daily and monthly energy consumption
- Reports usage about energy and working time
- Scheduling on working and inactive hours
