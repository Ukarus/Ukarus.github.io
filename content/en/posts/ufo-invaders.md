## Ufo Invaders

![Ufo Invaders Cover Image](/images/UfoInvadersBg.png)

Ufo invaders was a game i made for the CS50 course and it's heavily inspired by Space Invaders. This game was my first attempt at Unity and it was a bit of a challenge at that time. It features a score mechanic, powerups and it's difficulty increases every 10 seconds or so, adding more enemies to the level.
