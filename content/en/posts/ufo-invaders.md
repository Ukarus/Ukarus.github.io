Ufo invaders was a game i made for the [CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/) course and it's heavily inspired by Space Invaders. This game was my first attempt at Unity and it was a bit of a challenge at that time. It features a score mechanic, powerups, an infinite scrolling background and a score mechanic.
