Boxes and barrels was a game made in collaboration with [kameronbsmiley](https://kameronbsmiley.itch.io/), [HumdrumParrot](https://itch.io/profile/humdrumparrot), [ncollie](https://ncollie.itch.io/) and [Ukarus](https://blonjon.itch.io) (me). It was a submission for the [Godot Wild Jam](https://godotwildjam.com/) No 47. This is a puzzle game with a third person camera, it's heavily inspired by the [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) games.
