## Description

![Rage and snow Cover Image](/images/rage_and_snow_coverimage.png)

Rage and snow was the first game i did outside of a tutorial and the first one i made with a team, so it has a special place in my heart despite all it's bugs and flaws. It was made for the "Open Jam 2018" and the theme for that jam was "Spam to win" so it's a mix of platformer with a snowball spam mechanic.
