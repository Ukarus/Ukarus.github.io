Cowboy 50 is a game i made as a final project for the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) course. It's a basic shoot'em up that includes powerups, spawning enemies, sounds, music and a basic gameplay. It's a small clone of the mini game [Journey of the Prairie King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AjchLheDxw&t=57s) which can be played in Stardew Valley.
