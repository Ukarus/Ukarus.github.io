Cowboy 50 is a game i made as a final project for the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) course, it's a very basic shoot'em up that includes powerups, lots of enemies, sounds, music and a very basic gameplay. It was made with Love2D and with some assets from itch.io, it's a small clone of the mini game "[Journey of the Prairie King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AjchLheDxw&t=57s)" which can be played in Stardew Valley.
